/*
 * Simple content tracker
 *
 * The purpose of these functions is to track if content has changed
 * since a set point.
 *
 * Note: This should be used with backup.js as that does some initialization
 * for us and sets dataTrackingFunction. If you don't want to use backup.js
 * then this needs to be modified to do that itself.
 *
 * Some definitions:
 * A point in this file is a 'tracking point'. Which is a point in a data's
 * lifespan that you want to track. This can be for instance "backup", or "save",
 * to track changes since last backup or save respectively.
 *
 * This allows contentTracker to track multiple points at once.

 * Update the tracking point 'point' to the current data.
 * If global is boolean true then all other tracking points will also
 * get set to the current data. This is useful if you're tracking 'save'
 * and 'backup', and want to update 'backup' whenever you 'save'.
 *
 * Optionally, you may supply a third parameter, which is the data
 * to set at this track point. If the third is not supplied then the
 * usual dataTrackingFunction() will be called.
