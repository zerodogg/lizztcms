This directory contains various tools used by LizztCMS when in production.

flvConverter is the script used to convert video files of any filetype
to a flv file.

flvConverter.manual is a script that you can manually run to perform
a conversion of a video file. This is useful if the conversion failed
and you have repaired the cause. Simply run ./flvConverter.manual FILE_ID
and it will create an flv for FILE_ID and let you know when it has finished
and what the status is.

masontest.pl is a script that checks the syntax of HTML::Mason files,
the templating format used by LizztCMS.

lizztcmsIndexer.pl is a helper script for indexing individual articles or files
while LizztCMS is in production. It gets called automatically whenever
a file or article is created/updated/deleted. Mass indexing is done
in the daily cronjob.
