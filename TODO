(incomplete) TODO list for LizztCMS
- Improve code documentation
- Add automated failover for cdn-hosted libs
- Add support for proper (non-SiteHacks) plugins
- Rewrite ACL permissions (currently we store each path
	as either permitted or denied, rather use symbolic names
	that maps to sets of paths to simplify upgrades)
