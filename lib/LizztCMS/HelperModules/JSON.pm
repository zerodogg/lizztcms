# LizztCMS::HelperModules::JSON

# Read before using
# -----------------
# - After calling json_response or json_error catalyst *stops* processing.
# - The keys 'status', 'error' and 'human_error' in the reply is reserved for internal use
#
# Notes on Catalyst forwarding
# ----------------------------
# If you use a JSON module inside of a ->forward()ed action you may run into
# trouble, at least with the test server. This is because Catalyst *appears*
# to only ->detach() the forwarded one properly, the caller/parent that did the
# ->forward() appears to continue to execute, making catalyst hang on some
# syswrite() call that writes to STDOUT. So make sure that the action you
# ->forward to properly returns true if execution is allowed to continue,
# and false if it isn't (using these functions will result in a false return)
# and then do $c->forward('somethingthatcallsJSON') or $c->detach();
