=head1 LizztCMS URL MANUAL

LizztCMS has customizable URLs, defined by the I<template_url> and I<category_url>
settings in lizztcms.yml. These settings can be used to define how LizztCMS generates
URLs.

All URLs are made absolute by LizztCMS (ie. prefixed with /).

=head2 CATEGORY URLs

Category URLs can not be customized yet. You can only use the B<%c> placeholder, and
optionally prefix it with some pre-determined text.

=head2 ARTICLE URLs

Article URLs can be customized in any way you like. The default is: "%c/%a". Another
useful setting could be "%c/%A-%a". The bare minumum would be simply "%a".

=head2 URL PLACEHOLDERS

These are the URL placeholders that can be used in the above settings:

=over

=item B<%c>

Category name list. This generates a tree-like string, in the form: category1/subcat/subcat.
This is currently the only setting available for use in category URLs.

=item B<%a>

The article ID. B<MUST> be the last entry in any article URL.

=item B<%A>

The article title, cleaned for use in URLs.
